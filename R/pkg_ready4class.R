#' ready4class: Readyforwhatsnext Tools For Creating And Extending
#' Classes.
#'
#' ready4class provides classes and methods that
#' are designed to standardise and streamline the process for extending
#' the readyforwhatsnext data synthesis and simulation framework with new
#' classes.  This development version of the ready4class package has been
#' made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
#' package. That means this should be regarded as UNTESTED software,
#' which is provided for free WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. Importantly, the
#' tools contained in this test release automate a number of tasks which
#' MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  While we
#' welcome and appreciate anyone who takes the time to provide us with
#' feedback on this test release, we caution you that you should only
#' test this software if you feel confident you understand what it does
#' and have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake
#' testing. If you have any questions, please contact the authors
#' (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
