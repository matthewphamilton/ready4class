Description: ready4class provides classes and methods that
    are designed to standardise and streamline the process for extending
    the readyforwhatsnext data synthesis and simulation framework with new
    classes.  This development version of the ready4class package has been
    made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the
    package. That means this should be regarded as UNTESTED software,
    which is provided for free WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. Importantly, the
    tools contained in this test release automate a number of tasks which
    MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  While we
    welcome and appreciate anyone who takes the time to provide us with
    feedback on this test release, we caution you that you should only
    test this software if you feel confident you understand what it does
    and have created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake
    testing. If you have any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
